# Group Name: 
Wellness Finder
# Project Description: 
Wellness website that will search API's to find closest exercise classes and calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). You will choose between four choices: Yoga Studio, Pilates studio, Gym, and Weight loss center. Next, the user will input their age, weight (lbs.), and height to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). We are hoping that the information we provide will be of use to the user's health.
